# GPIO-LED-SWITCH
The objective of this subproject is to control both internal and external  LEDs using a push-button.

The objective of this subproject is to control both internal and external LEDs using a push-button. Furthermore, we will explore how to implement an interrupt to execute a second code when the button is pressed. To accomplish this, we will utilize the development tools from the previous lab session, including the "STM32F4" microcontroller and the software tools "STM32CubeMX" and "IAR."
